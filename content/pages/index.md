          **Stay tuned as we start building high-end Enterprise-class servers
          capable of supporting the SOL network**.


          Solana is a decentralized computing platform that uses SOL to pay for
          transactions. Solana aims to improve blockchain scalability by using a
          combination of proof of stake consensus and so-called evidence of
          history. As a result, Solana claims to be able to support 50,000
          transactions per second without sacrificing decentralization.
